## Brief Description
I created Eir when I was interning at Intuit with the backend team of Turbo Tax. Eir is an internal
dashboard that allows teams to monitor their service's health. It is backed with a mySQL database and was developed using the Play Framework.  The tools monitors health of servers by pinging the specified
health checks and displaying the health of all servers in a service. When a service is down, a Slack message is sent to the teamâ€™s
Slack channel.

*I am unable to show snippets of code or screenshot due to the company restrictions.*
